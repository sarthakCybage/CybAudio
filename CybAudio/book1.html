                        Gatsby is known for hosting extravagant parties in the hope that his lost love, Daisy Buchanan,
                        will attend. Daisy is married to Tom Buchanan, a wealthy but arrogant man. As the narrative
                        unfolds, it becomes clear that Gatsby's wealth is a facade to win back Daisy, and the novel
                        delves into the complexities of their relationships.

                        The book portrays the decadence and excess of the Jazz Age, critiquing the superficiality and
                        moral decay of society during that time. Tragedy ensues as characters grapple with illusions,
                        unrequited love, and the consequences of their choices. Fitzgerald's writing captures the
                        essence of the American Dream and its disillusionment, making "The Great Gatsby" a timeless
                        exploration of the human condition.

                F. Scott Fitzgerald (born September 24, 1896, St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S.—died December 21, 1940, Hollywood, California) American short-story writer and novelist famous for his depictions of the Jazz Age (the 1920s), his most brilliant novel being The Great Gatsby (1925). His private life, with his wife, Zelda, in both America and France, became almost as celebrated as his novels.
                Fitzgerald was the only son of an unsuccessful, aristocratic father and an energetic, provincial mother. Half the time he thought of himself as the heir of his father’s tradition, which included the author of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” Francis Scott Key, after whom he was named, and half the time as “straight 1850 potato-famine Irish.” As a result he had typically ambivalent American feelings about American life, which seemed to him at once vulgar and dazzlingly promising.
